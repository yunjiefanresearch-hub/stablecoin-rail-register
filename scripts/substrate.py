"""Constraint substrate (v0.9.0): derive corridor feasibility by composing per-jurisdiction C1-C8
poles through the six interaction-set rules — the deeper engine behind the single-gate compose().

This does NOT replace scripts/compose.py; it is an additive, deeper derivation that is cross-checked
against it. Where the substrate yields a definite class it must agree with the signal-table compose();
where a load-bearing pole is unset it returns 'indeterminate' (it never guesses), so its coverage is
bounded by — and reports — the constraint-cell backlog.
