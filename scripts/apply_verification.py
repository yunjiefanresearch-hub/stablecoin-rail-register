"""
apply_verification.py — land the external primary-source verification pass (v0.9.5) onto the register.

The external artifact (web retrieval against official sources, 2026-06-27) located the official instrument
+ URL for each original-seven-jurisdiction cell and reported, per cell, whether the proposition is
confirmed against the official text AND the BINDING STATUS of the instrument it rests on.

DISCIPLINE (the deep-review correction): the verification's own central finding is that a blanket
promotion to resolution_text is WRONG. Citability is capped by binding status, independent of whether
the text was located:

  in_force_enacted          -> resolution_text-eligible (enacted statute, in force now)
  made_not_commenced        -> NOT in-force law (UK SI 2026/102, commences 2027-10-25)      -> firm_summary
  finalized_policy_pending  -> finalized policy, not enacted (SG MAS SCS framework)         -> firm_summary
  pending_proposal          -> bill / NPRM / consultation (US CLARITY, OCC NPRM, BR BCB)     -> firm_summary
  prohibition / no_regime   -> no positive permitted-activity rule to confirm (CN)           -> stays unset

So this promotes ONLY in_force_enacted cells confirmed against official text (EU MiCA, US GENIUS
statutory parts, HK Cap. 656), attaches the official URL + a `verification` block, and records
binding_status on every record (explicit dispositions below, status-based fallback elsewhere). It NEVER
fabricates a URL or a confirmation. Idempotent; patches YAML in place; emits the ledger audit trail.
