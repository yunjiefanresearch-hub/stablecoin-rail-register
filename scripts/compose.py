"""The computed layer (preview) — turn the composition-problem thesis into a running function.

The Architecture paper's central claim is that cross-border feasibility is a *composition* of
single-jurisdiction constraints; the Atlas's 132 directed classifications are the hand-output of
that composition. v0.5.x stored both layers but never *computed* anything: the §5.14 matrix and the
corridors were independent transcriptions. This module takes the first real step toward a computable,
self-checking graph:

  1. derive a small, auditable per-jurisdiction signal table from the node records (where it can be
     read off cleanly — e.g. pre-regime status — it is; the inbound-gate *type* is an explicit,
     annotated table because it is a documentary judgment, not a single field);
  2. implement compose_directed(origin, destination) using the Atlas's OWN stated algorithm
     (§3.2 destination-determined class + origin drag/override);
  3. DIFF the computed class against the authored values — the authored directed feasibility_class
     of the 9 corridors, and (via a documented reduction) the authored §5.14 undirected categories;
  4. emit analysis/computed_compatibility.json, where every computed-vs-authored disagreement is a
     FINDING with a named cause, not a silent contradiction.

This is deliberately a *preview*: compose_directed is NOT asserted to be authoritative. Its value is
that it reproduces most authored classifications from first principles and that its disagreements
localise exactly where the two source papers (Atlas directed vs Architecture undirected) diverge —
which is where the research interest is. Run: python3 scripts/compose.py
