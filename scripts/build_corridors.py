"""Expand the corridor layer from the single worked example (hk-br) toward the
directed-edge model of the Cross-Border Digital-Finance Corridor Atlas v0.2.3.

The Atlas treats the corridor — a directed origin->destination edge — as the unit of
analysis (132 directed edges across the twelve jurisdictions). Until v0.5.0 the register
encoded only one corridor, so "corridor layer" was a single example rather than a layer.
This builder transcribes the highest-demand / most structurally-illustrative directed
edges from the Atlas §5 deep-dives, each carrying the Atlas attributes:

  feasibility_class · compatibility_category (link to Architecture §5.14) · currencies ·
  archetypes (RC/SC/TC/DC) · operative interaction sets (A-F) · infrastructure overlap ·
  inbound mechanism + administrator · origin-override flag · note.

build.py passes any YAML with a `corridor_id` through into dataset.json["corridors"].
The deeply-verified hk-br-usd-stablecoin-settlement corridor is kept as the anchor and is
NOT regenerated here. Directional pairs are kept distinct (US->EU and EU->US are two
edges) because the inbound gate differs by direction — the Atlas's core thesis.
