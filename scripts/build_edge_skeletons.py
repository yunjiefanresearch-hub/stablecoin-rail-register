"""Edge-layer densification (v0.9.4). The 9 hand-authored corridor records are the ENRICHED gold tier
(they carry infrastructure_overlap, bespoke inbound detail, curated archetypes, prose). For every OTHER
derivable directed edge this emits a COMPUTED SKELETON: the structurally-derivable fields only —
feasibility class (from the substrate), inbound mechanism test + administrator (re-projected from the
destination's C1/C7 record), a baseline archetype set, the directed interaction sets, and provenance.

It introduces no new facts: the inbound test/administrator are re-read from existing records, the class is
the already-cross-checked substrate class, and the genuinely EMPIRICAL fields (infrastructure_overlap,
bespoke detail, curated archetypes, prose) are left explicitly UNSET as a per-edge enrichment backlog.
Emits analysis/computed_corridor_skeletons.json."""
