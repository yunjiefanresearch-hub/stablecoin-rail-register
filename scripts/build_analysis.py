"""Build the ANALYSIS LAYER — the queryable encoding of the Cross-Border Stablecoin
Architecture v3 working paper's analytical payload.

Until v0.5.0 the register encoded the Compliance Matrix *node* layer at high fidelity
but left the Architecture paper's actual contribution — the composition-problem
apparatus — living only in PDF prose. This builder lifts four artifacts into
structured, schema-validated, machine-queryable JSON:

  analysis/interaction_sets.json      — the six constraint-interaction sets (§2.9, A–F)
  analysis/architectural_patterns.json — the PRC three-pattern typology (§3.3),
                                         the three-layer routing architecture (§4/§6),
                                         the §4.4 five-factor operational test,
                                         and the six design principles
  analysis/compatibility.json         — the §5.14 pairwise compatibility matrix
                                         (all 66 unordered jurisdiction pairs)
  analysis/open_questions.json        — the §7 open questions with conditional-status flags

build.py reads these (validating against analysis.schema.json) and folds them into
dataset.json under an `analysis` key, so a single fetch of dataset.json delivers both
the node layer and the analysis layer. The standalone files remain for direct access.
